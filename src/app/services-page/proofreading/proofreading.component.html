                    <p class="mb-4">In the academic world, plagiarism is considered the non-plus ultra of intellectual theft. Plagiarism is understood as the adoption of someone elseâ€™s thoughts without identifying them as those. Plagiarism scandals that have become popular show the consequences of such an unmarked takeover. In doing so, plagiarism does not have to be done consciously: Since scientific texts necessarily rely on the integration of external sources, in spite of great care, unwanted transfer of third-party content without any labeling is possible.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">In order to avoid plagiarism, it is advisable to subject written texts to a plagiarism check. This can be done on the one hand on the basis of the most modern plagiarism scanners and on the other hand on the basis of a manual plagiarism check. In any case, you should protect yourself against unpleasant surprises by checking your own work for possible plagiarism before submitting it. We are happy to be at your disposal here to guide you safely to your goal in the last few meters of your academic success!</p>
